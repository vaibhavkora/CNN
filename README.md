# CIFAR-10 Image Classification Using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) 🚀

## Overview 🌟
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into 10 categories (e.g., airplane, automobile, bird). Developed in a Jupyter Notebook (`CNN.ipynb`) using TensorFlow, it’s an excellent resource for machine learning enthusiasts and data scientists exploring image classification with deep learning! 🧠💻 The model is trained on a GPU-accelerated environment (e.g., Google Colab with T4 GPU) for efficient computation.

## 📂 Dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset, included in TensorFlow’s `keras.datasets`, consists of:
- **Training Set**: 50,000 RGB images (32x32 pixels) 📸
- **Test Set**: 10,000 RGB images (32x32 pixels) 📸
- **Classes**: 10 categories (airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck) ✈️🚗🐦
- **Pixel Values**: Normalized to [0, 1] for model training 🎨

The notebook automatically loads the dataset using `datasets.cifar10.load_data()`. 📥

## 🛠️ Project Structure
The notebook (`CNN.ipynb`) is organized into the following steps:

1. **Library Imports** 📚
   - TensorFlow for CNN implementation 🧠
   - Matplotlib for visualization 📊
   - Keras (via TensorFlow) for dataset and model layers 🛠️

2. **Data Loading & Preprocessing** 🔍
   - Loads CIFAR-10 dataset with `datasets.cifar10.load_data()`
   - Normalizes pixel values to [0, 1] by dividing by `255.0` ⚙️

3. **Data Visualization** 🎨
   - Displays a **5x5 grid** of 25 training images with their class labels using Matplotlib 👀
   - Class names: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck 🐾

4. **Model Evaluation** 🏆
   - Outputs the test accuracy (`test_acc`) of the trained CNN model 📈
   - **Reported accuracy**: **70.77%** 🎯

Note: The notebook does not include the CNN model architecture or training steps, but these are assumed to be present in the complete notebook (e.g., using `models.Sequential` with convolutional and dense layers).
